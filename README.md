# Yet Another LALR(1) Parser Generator

Parseon is a LALR (Look-Ahead, Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation) parser generator implemented by following many of the algorithms described in the [dragon textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811). This was made as an educational project to learn about parsers, but also to use in implementing a programming language that I am building from scratch.


TODO:
  - Rust documentation
  - example in the readme
  - functionality to compile the action table to a rust file
  - benchmarking
  - CI for code coverage, test passing, minimum Rust version
  - error state recovery
  - integration tests
